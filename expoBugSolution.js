Several approaches can address this cryptic Expo CLI error:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version of Expo CLI installed globally:  `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. **Clear Expo Cache:**  Remove any cached Expo data that might be conflicting with the current project setup. You can do this by deleting the `.expo` and `node_modules` directories within your project, then reinstalling dependencies: `npm install`
3. **Check Package.json:** Verify that your project's `package.json` file is accurate and that all dependencies are compatible with your Expo CLI version and each other. Check for version mismatches or outdated packages and update accordingly.
4. **Reinstall Node Modules:** Remove and reinstall your node modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
5. **Check your project's configuration:** Ensure your `app.json` or `expo.json` file is properly configured and doesn't contain any syntax errors. 
6. **Create New Project:** As a last resort, try creating a new Expo project using `expo init my-new-project` and compare the configurations. This helps to isolate whether the issue lies within your project's setup or Expo CLI itself.

The `expoBugSolution.js` file provides a minimal example demonstrating how to implement the above steps within a project.
